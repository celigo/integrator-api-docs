Export API
==========
>**Guidance**: this API is typically only needed for SmartConnector development (where you need to create exports in your installer, or dynamically configure exports based on settings that you expose in your app), or for Embedded Integration development (where you want to automate deploying your exports via cloning or dynamically creating them from scratch).
