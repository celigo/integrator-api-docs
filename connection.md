| **rest.authURI**            | No       | This field is used for the oauth2 authentication process. This URL identifies the endpoint to be used when making the initial oauth2 http authentication requests.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **rest.authHeader**         | No       | If the authentication method being used has a custom auth header, this field can be used to override the RFC default                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **rest.authScheme**         | No       | Used to override the default authScheme name if a given authentication method does not follow the respective RFC spec.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **rest.disableStrictSSL**   | No       | This optional flag that, if set, skips verifying the SSL certificate (allow self-signed or expired certs) Only set this value if you are having problems reported with the SSL connection, and you accept the risks of ignoring the validity of the SSL certificate.                                                               |
| **rest.retryHeader**        | No       | It is common for rest API's to return 429 errors if too many requests are made in a given amount of time. 429 responses are typically paired with a "retry-after" response header. It is however possible that an API may use a custom header. This field allows a user to override the default.                                   |
| **rest.basicAuth.username** | No       | If basic authentication is used, this is the username to be used when generating the Authentication header value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **rest.basicAuth.password** | No       | If basic authentication is used, this is the password to be used when generating the Authentication header value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **rest._iClientId**         | No       | A reference to an IClient resource. This can be ignored unless the connection is used int he context of a Connector.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **rest.info**               | No       | This field is used internally to hold profile data returned from OAuth2 responses from the authentication authority.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **rest.pingRelativeURI**    | No       | This is any URI that can be used to test connections. Integrator.io tests connections periodically by making GET requests to this endpoint in order to verify the authentication criteria. If ping requests fail then the connection is turned offline and any flow using the connection will not run, even if scheduled to do so. |
| **rest.pingSuccessPath**    | No       | Some API's send a 200 http status code in the ping response even if the request fails. Instead these services rely on data in the response body to identify success/fail. This field can be used to specific the json path of the field used to identify success.                                                                  |
| **rest.concurrencyLevel**   | No       | If the api represented by this connection has specific concurrency restrictions (simultaneous requests), its possible to specific them using this field. Otherwise a default "burst" mode will be used where multiple http requests will be made at the same time. Burst mode benefits imports most.                               |
