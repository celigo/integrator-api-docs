Template API
===========
>**Guidance**: there are no known use cases for accessing the template resource type via API (vs just using the integrator.io UI). For now, this page is just a placeholder, and we will update our guidance if a good use case is ever discovered.  :)

    {
        "_id": "123ab456c789de1011fg12h13i",
        "name": "Send GitHub Notifications to Slack",
        "description": "This is a very simple integration that listens for commit events in GitHub, and then posts messages to Slack so that people can use Slack to monitor developer activity.  The benefit of using this integration vs the free integration provided by Slack is that you can customize how the messages post to Slack.  For example, you might want messages to post as if they were sent by the user that triggered the event in GitHub (vs a generic bot type user).",

Very similar to the native integration that Slack has in their integration marketplace, except now you can completely customize how the messages appear in Slack. For example, you might want to minimize the message content that gets sent to Slack to only show the repository, user, and build status.",
